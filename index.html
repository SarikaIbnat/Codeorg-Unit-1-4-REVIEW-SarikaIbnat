    <b>Unit 1</b>
    <hr>
   <p> In Unit 1 we explored the binary system and how computers communicate and process data. We learned Bits and Bytes are used to store information like numbers, images, texts, etc. Bits consist of 0s and 1s and a Byte consists of 8 bits. We also learned that Lossy compression is when you transfer any less important data using fewer bits causing some of the information to be lost from the original. On the other hand, no data is lost while transferring using Lossless compression even though that takes more storage space and transmission time. Most importantly, we developed our problem-solving skills through the ability to debug to run our code efficiently.

      <b>Unit 2</b>
      <hr>
     <p> In Unit 2 we learned about the Internet and its ability to connect billions of devices and people to one another. Moreover, we learned about computer networks and the servers. Furthermore, we learned about Web Protocols such as DNS (Domain Name System) that a web browser uses to find an IP address. Furthermore, we created a website that educates about some of the digital dilemmas that exist.

      <b>Unit 3</b>
     <p>Unit 3 was an intro to app designing. We used a lot of pair programming skills such as designing an app with a partner. Our debugging skills really came in handy with this unit. We created an user interface and got to test around how to play sounds, use a button to set screens, etc.

        <div class="wave" id="u4">
          <b>Unit 4</b>
          <hr>
         <p>In Unit 4, we learned how to create variables, conditionals and functions. These concepts help to make the apps more complex and make the app more interactive with the users. We did a series of projects such as a Ticket price generator based on the userâ€™s age, day of the week and if the user has a valid coupon. Most importantly, we used debugging to make the code run properly without errors.
