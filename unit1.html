  <div id="left"><h1>Lesson #C.F.U </h1>
    <p>The Answer</p>
    <div class="wave" id= "l1-1">
      <b> Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</b>
    <h4> Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b> What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b>We are quickly escalating to learning more tags each day and it's getting harder to remember what a tag does but, since we are using the  tags we learned earlier over and over again, it's helping to not forget what they do. My experience is similar to the second student and I think it would help me if I take notes and then also summarize the new tags and their functions at the end of the day.</p>

      <b> Lesson 2: Representing Information</b>
      <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b>Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b>The reason for that was to not get things confusing or complicated. Also, I think that's how computer processes information with just two options.</p>

      <b> Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</b>
      <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</b>The number system basically contains up to 9 numbers and then, the pattern repeats itself like 1 and 0 makes a 10 when you put them together.</p>

      <b> Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</b>
      <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b>Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have? & Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</b> The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system. & The numbers that we can make doubles.</p>

      <b> Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding</b>
      <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?</b>The odometer will reset to 0.</p>

      <b> Lesson 8: Color Images</b>

      <b> Lesson 9: Lossless Compression</b>
      <h4>Check for Understanding</h4>
      <p><b>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</b> The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.</p>

      <b> Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</b>

      <p><b>Youâ€™ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b> Video and music are best compressed using lossless compression because they won't lose any data. Images and texts are best compressed using lossy compression because restoring all of the data perfectly isn't necessary</p>
